###### This article deals with our current php/Symfony/Drupal 8 training session. It's very interesting because we can learn a lot of new informatic languages but it's quite tough. You really have to keep pace ! In order to participate to that training, I had to move to Saint-Herblain, a little town right next to Nantes, in Loire-Atlantique department. It's a nice city with a lot of sights to visit. I especially hope to go to "The Island Machines", because that seems very unique and original.
